<!--
Represents the basics required to make GWT2 able to compile just the serialization
API. Additionally, one of these two modules to inherit, depending on how you are
using GWT:

  * com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.GwtUserFallback - if you are currently still
    using other classes from gwt-user, you must use this
  * com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.LegacyRpcClasses - if you do not use other
    classes from gwt-user, use this module instead to better future-proof yourself
